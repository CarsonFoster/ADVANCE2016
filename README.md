# ADVANCE2016
My textual version of PacMan from the 2016 ADVANCE Program for Young Scholars.

# Support
I wrote this program during the final week of the 2016 ADVANCE C++ course, so there will be no continued support or updates.
The program is provided as-is, with no guarantees made, and so on.

# Purpose
## Since this repository will have no further changes, what's the point?
I am simply using this repo to store a nostalgic program for myself (and make sure I will never lose it).
