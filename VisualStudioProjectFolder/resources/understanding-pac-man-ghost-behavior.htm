focuses on a specific game mechanic that would normally only be known to
 high-level players of a particular game, and attempts to explain it in a
 manner that would be understandable even by readers unfamiliar with 
that game.</p>

    <div class="post_date">Posted on December 2, 2010</div>
    <p>It only seems right for me to begin this blog with the topic that
 inspired me to start it in the first place. Not too long ago, I came 
across <a href="http://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Fhome.comcast.net%2F%7Ejpittman2%2Fpacman%2Fpacmandossier.html&amp;t=MmEwODExYjVkZGU2MmI0MTExMTBjY2NiNjNkMzQyNjU4MTY2NWQwMyxoZFVVbmpJRg%3D%3D" target="_blank">Jamey Pittman’s “Pac-Man Dossier”</a>,
 which is a ridiculously-detailed explanation of the mechanics of 
Pac-Man. I found it absolutely fascinating, so this site is my attempt 
to discover and aggregate similarly-detailed information about other 
games (albeit in much smaller chunks). However, as a bit of a tribute, 
I’m going to start with Pac-Man as well, specifically the ghost AI. It’s
 an interesting topic, and hopefully my explanation will be a bit more 
accessible than Jamey’s, due to focusing on only the information 
relevant to ghost behavior.</p>

<h2>About the Game</h2>

<blockquote>
“All the computer games available at the time were of the violent type -
 war games and space invader types. There were no games that everyone 
could enjoy, and especially none for women. I wanted to come up with a 
"comical” game women could enjoy.“
<div class="quote-source">- Toru Iwatani, Pac-Man creator</div>
</blockquote>

<p>Pac-Man is one of the most iconic video games of all time, and most 
people (even non-gamers) have at least a passing familiarity with it. 
The purpose of the game is very simple — the player is placed in a maze 
filled with food (depicted as pellets or dots) and needs to eat all of 
it to advance to the next level. This task is made difficult by four 
ghosts that pursue Pac-Man through the maze. If Pac-Man makes contact 
with any of the ghosts, the player loses a life and the positions of 
Pac-Man and the ghosts are reset back to their starting locations, 
though any dots that were eaten remain so. Other than simply avoiding 
them, Pac-Man’s only defense against the ghosts are the four larger 
"energizer” pellets located at the corners of the maze. Eating one 
causes the ghosts to become frightened and retreat for a short time, and
 in the early levels of the game Pac-Man can even eat the ghosts for 
bonus points during this period. An eaten ghost is not completely 
eliminated, but is returned to its starting position before resuming its
 pursuit. Other than eating dots and ghosts, the only other source of 
points are the two pieces of fruit which appear during each level near 
the middle of the maze. The first fruit appears when Pac-Man has eaten 
70 of the dots in the maze, and the second when 170 have been eaten.</p>

<img class="right" src="understanding-pac-man-ghost-behavior_files/initial-playfield.png"><p>Every
 level of Pac-Man uses the same maze layout, containing 240 regular 
“food” dots and 4 energizers. The tunnels that lead off of the left and 
right edges of the screen act as shortcuts to the opposite side of the 
screen, and are usable by both Pac-Man and the ghosts, though the 
ghosts’ speed is greatly reduced while they are in the tunnel. Even 
though the layout is always the same, the levels become increasingly 
difficult due to modifications to Pac-Man’s speed, as well as changes to
 both the speed and behavior of the ghosts. After reaching level 21, no 
further changes to the game’s mechanics are made, and every level from 
21 onwards is effectively identical.</p>

<h2>Common Elements of Ghost Behaviour</h2>

<blockquote>
“Well, there’s not much entertainment in a game of eating, so we decided
 to create enemies to inject a little excitement and tension. The player
 had to fight the enemies to get the food. And each of the enemies has 
its own character. The enemies are four little ghost-shaped monsters, 
each of them a different colour - blue, yellow, pink and red. I used 
four different colours mostly to please the women who play - I thought 
they would like the pretty colours.”
<div class="quote-source">- Toru Iwatani, Pac-Man creator</div>
</blockquote>

<p>Each of the ghosts is programmed with an individual “personality”, a 
different algorithm it uses to determine its method of moving through 
the maze. Understanding how each ghost behaves is extremely important to
 be able to effectively avoid them. However, before discussing their 
individual behaviors, let’s first examine the logic that they share.</p>

<h3>The Ghost House</h3>

<p>When a player begins a game of Pac-Man, they are not immediately 
attacked by all four of the ghosts. As shown on the diagram of the 
initial game position, only one ghost begins in the actual maze, while 
the others are inside a small area in the middle of the maze, often 
referred to as the “ghost house”. Other than at the beginning of a 
level, the ghosts will only return to this area if they are eaten by an 
energized Pac-Man, or as a result of their positions being reset when 
Pac-Man dies. The ghost house is otherwise inaccessible, and is not a 
valid area for Pac-Man or the ghosts to move into. Ghosts always move to
 the left as soon as they leave the ghost house, but they may reverse 
direction almost immediately due to an effect that will be described 
later.</p>

<p>The conditions that determine when the three ghosts that start inside
 the ghost house are able to leave it are actually fairly complex. 
Because of this, I’m going to consider them outside the scope of this 
article, especially since they become much less relevant after 
completing the first few levels. If you’re interested in reading about 
these rules (and an interesting exploit of them), the Pac-Man Dossier <a href="http://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Fhome.comcast.net%2F%7Ejpittman2%2Fpacman%2Fpacmandossier.html%23CH2+-+Home+Sweet+Home&amp;t=MzU0YTNmMmU1N2QzNTE2YmY2YTJlOWI3NTc2OTk3NjU5ZjBjODU4YyxoZFVVbmpJRg%3D%3D" target="_blank">covers them in-depth</a>, as always.</p>

<h3>Target Tiles</h3>

<img class="right" src="understanding-pac-man-ghost-behavior_files/tiled-playfield.png"><p>Much
 of Pac-Man’s design and mechanics revolve around the idea of the board 
being split into tiles. “Tile” in this context refers to an 8 x 8 pixel 
square on the screen. Pac-Man’s screen resolution is 224 x 288, so this 
gives us a total board size of 28 x 36 tiles, though most of these are 
not accessible to Pac-Man or the ghosts. As an example of the impact of 
tiles, a ghost is considered to have caught Pac-Man when it occupies the
 same tile as him. In addition, every pellet in the maze is in the 
center of its own tile. It should be noted that since the sprites for 
Pac-Man and the ghosts are larger than one tile in size, they are never 
completely contained in a single tile. Due to this, for the game’s 
purposes, the character is considered to occupy whichever tile contains 
its <em>center point</em>. This is important knowledge when avoiding 
ghosts, since Pac-Man will only be caught if a ghost manages to move its
 center point into the same tile as Pac-Man’s.</p>

<p>The key to understanding ghost behavior is the concept of a target 
tile. The large majority of the time, each ghost has a specific tile 
that it is trying to reach, and its behavior revolves around trying to 
get to that tile from its current one. All of the ghosts use identical 
methods to travel towards their targets, but the different ghost 
personalities come about due to the individual way each ghost has of 
selecting its target tile. Note that there are no restrictions that a 
target tile must actually be possible to reach, they can (and often are)
 located on an inaccessible tile, and many of the common ghost behaviors
 are a direct result of this possibility. Target tiles will be discussed
 in more detail in upcoming sections, but for now just keep in mind that
 the ghosts are almost always motivated by trying to reach a particular 
tile.</p>

<h3>Ghost Movement Modes</h3>

<p>The ghosts are always in one of three possible modes: Chase, Scatter,
 or Frightened. The “normal” mode with the ghosts pursuing Pac-Man is 
Chase, and this is the one that they spend most of their time in. While 
in Chase mode, all of the ghosts use Pac-Man’s position as a factor in 
selecting their target tile, though it is more significant to some 
ghosts than others. In Scatter mode, each ghost has a fixed target tile,
 each of which is located just outside a different corner of the maze. 
This causes the four ghosts to disperse to the corners whenever they are
 in this mode. Frightened mode is unique because the ghosts do not have a
 specific target tile while in this mode. Instead, they <a href="http://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FPseudorandom_number_generator&amp;t=MTk5MjAxM2U2YWI2ZjYzY2YxMmE0ZGE3Mjg4ZjkzOGYxYmMyODZhMSxoZFVVbmpJRg%3D%3D" target="_blank">pseudorandomly</a>
 decide which turns to make at every intersection. A ghost in Frightened
 mode also turns dark blue, moves much more slowly and can be eaten by 
Pac-Man. However, the duration of Frightened mode is shortened as the 
player progresses through the levels, and is completely eliminated from 
level 19 onwards.</p>

<blockquote>
“To give the game some tension, I wanted the monsters to surround Pac 
Man at some stage of the game. But I felt it would be too stressful for a
 human being like Pac Man to be continually surrounded and hunted down. 
So I created the monsters’ invasions to come in waves. They’d attack and
 then they’d retreat. As time went by they would regroup, attack, and 
disperse again. It seemed more natural than having constant attack.”
<div class="quote-source">- Toru Iwatani, Pac-Man creator</div>
</blockquote>

<p>Changes between Chase and Scatter modes occur on a fixed timer, which
 causes the “wave” effect described by Iwatani. This timer is reset at 
the beginning of each level and whenever a life is lost. The timer is 
also paused while the ghosts are in Frightened mode, which occurs 
whenever Pac-Man eats an energizer. When Frightened mode ends, the 
ghosts return to their previous mode, and the timer resumes where it 
left off. The ghosts start out in Scatter mode, and there are four waves
 of Scatter/Chase alternation defined, after which the ghosts will 
remain in Chase mode indefinitely (until the timer is reset). For the 
first level, the durations of these phases are:</p>

<ol><li>Scatter for 7 seconds, then Chase for 20 seconds.</li>
    <li>Scatter for 7 seconds, then Chase for 20 seconds.</li>
    <li>Scatter for 5 seconds, then Chase for 20 seconds.</li>
    <li>Scatter for 5 seconds, then switch to Chase mode permanently.</li>
</ol><p>The durations of these phases are changed somewhat when the 
player reaches level 2, and once again when they reach level 5. Starting
 on level 2, the third Chase mode lengthens considerably, to 1033 
seconds (17 minutes and 13 seconds), and the following Scatter mode 
lasts just 1/60 of a second before the ghosts proceed to their permanent
 Chase mode. The level 5 changes build on top of this, additionally 
reducing the first two Scatter lengths to 5 seconds, and adding the 4 
seconds gained here to the third Chase mode, lengthening it to 1037 
seconds (17:17). Regarding the 1/60-of-a-second Scatter mode on every 
level except the first, even though it may seem that switching modes for
 such an insignificant amount of time is pointless, there is a reason 
behind it, which shall be revealed shortly.</p>

<h3>Basic Ghost Movement Rules</h3>

<p>The next step is understanding exactly <em>how</em> the ghosts 
attempt to reach their target tiles. The ghosts’ AI is very simple and 
short-sighted, which makes the complex behavior of the ghosts even more 
impressive. Ghosts only ever plan one step into the future as they move 
about the maze. Whenever a ghost enters a new tile, it looks ahead to 
the next tile that it will reach, and makes a decision about which 
direction it will turn when it gets there. These decisions have one very
 important restriction, which is that ghosts may never choose to reverse
 their direction of travel. That is, a ghost cannot enter a tile from 
the left side and then decide to reverse direction and move back to the 
left. The implication of this restriction is that whenever a ghost 
enters a tile with only two exits, it will always continue in the same 
direction.</p>

<p>However, there is one exception to this rule, which is that whenever 
ghosts change from Chase or Scatter to any other mode, they are <em>forced</em>
 to reverse direction as soon as they enter the next tile. This forced 
instruction will overwrite whatever decision the ghosts had previously 
made about the direction to move when they reach that tile. This 
effectively acts as a notifier to the player that the ghosts have 
changed modes, since it is the only time a ghost can possibly reverse 
direction. Note that when the ghosts leave Frightened mode they do not 
change direction, but this particular switch is already obvious due to 
the ghosts reverting to their regular colors from the dark blue of 
Frightened. So then, the 1/60-of-a-second Scatter mode on every level 
after the first will cause all the ghosts to reverse their direction of 
travel, even though their target effectively remains the same. This 
forced direction-reversal instruction is also applied to any ghosts 
still inside the ghost house, so a ghost that hasn’t yet entered the 
maze by the time the first mode switch occurs will exit the ghost house 
with a “reverse direction as soon as you can” instruction already 
pending. This causes them to move left as usual for a very short time, 
but they will almost immediately reverse direction and go to the right 
instead.</p>

<img class="center" src="understanding-pac-man-ghost-behavior_files/intersection-map.png"><p>The
 diagram above shows a simplified representation of the maze layout. 
Decisions are only necessary at all when approaching “intersection” 
tiles, which are indicated in green on the diagram.</p>

<img class="left" src="understanding-pac-man-ghost-behavior_files/decision.png"><p>When
 a decision about which direction to turn is necessary, the choice is 
made based on which tile adjoining the intersection will put the ghost 
nearest to its target tile, measured in a straight line. The distance 
from every possibility to the target tile is measured, and whichever 
tile is closest to the target will be selected. In the diagram to the 
left, the ghost will turn upwards at the intersection. If two or more 
potential choices are an equal distance from the target, the decision 
between them is made in the order of up &gt; left &gt; down. A decision 
to exit right can never be made in a situation where two tiles are 
equidistant to the target, since any other option has a higher priority.</p>

<img class="right" src="understanding-pac-man-ghost-behavior_files/bad-decision.png"><p>Since
 the only consideration is which tile will immediately place the ghost 
closer to its target, this can result in the ghosts selecting the 
“wrong” turn when the initial choice places them closer, but the overall
 path is longer. An example is shown to the right, where straight-line 
measurement makes exiting left appear to be a better choice. However, 
this will result in an overall path length of 26 tiles to reach the 
target, when exiting right would have had a path only 8 tiles long.</p> 

<p>One final special case to be aware of are the four intersections that
 were colored yellow on the simplified maze diagram. These specific 
intersections have an extra restriction — ghosts can not choose to turn 
upwards from these tiles. If entering them from the right or left side 
they will always proceed out the opposite side (excepting a forced 
direction-reversal). Note that this restriction does not apply to 
Frightened mode, and Frightened ghosts may turn upwards here if that 
decision occurs randomly. A ghost entering these tiles from the top can 
also reverse direction back out the top if a mode switch occurs as they 
are entering the tile, the restriction is only applied during “regular” 
decision-making. If Pac-Man is being pursued closely by ghosts, he can 
gain some ground on them by making an upwards turn in one of these 
intersections, since they will be forced to take a longer route around.</p>

<h2>Individual Ghost Personalities</h2>

<blockquote>
“This is the heart of the game. I wanted each ghostly enemy to have a 
specific character and its own particular movements, so they weren’t all
 just chasing after Pac Man in single file, which would have been 
tiresome and flat.” 
<div class="quote-source">- Toru Iwatani, Pac-Man creator</div>
</blockquote>

<img class="center" src="understanding-pac-man-ghost-behavior_files/ghost-names.png"><p>As
 has been previously mentioned, the only differences between the ghosts 
are their methods of selecting target tiles in Chase and Scatter modes. 
The only official description of each ghost’s personality comes from the
 one-word “character” description shown in the game’s attract mode. 
We’ll first take a look at how the ghosts behave in Scatter mode, since 
it’s extremely straightforward, and then look at each ghost’s approach 
to targeting in Chase mode.</p>

<h3>Scatter Mode</h3>

<img class="right" src="understanding-pac-man-ghost-behavior_files/scatter-targets.png"><p>Each
 ghost has a pre-defined, fixed target tile while in this mode, located 
just outside the corners of the maze. When Scatter mode begins, each 
ghost will head towards their “home” corner using their regular 
path-finding methods. However, since the actual target tiles are 
inaccessible and the ghosts cannot stop moving or reverse direction, 
they are forced to continue past the target, but will turn back towards 
it as soon as possible. This results in each ghost’s path eventually 
becoming a fixed loop in their corner. If left in Scatter mode, each 
ghost would remain in its loop indefinitely. In practice, the duration 
of Scatter mode is always quite short, so the ghosts often do not have 
time to even reach their corner or complete a circuit of their loop 
before reverting back to Chase mode. The diagram shows each ghost’s 
target tile and eventual looping path, color-coded to match their own 
color.</p>

<h3>The Red Ghost</h3>

<img class="right" src="understanding-pac-man-ghost-behavior_files/blinky-targeting.png"><p>The
 red ghost starts outside of the ghost house, and is usually the first 
one to be seen as a threat, since he makes a beeline for Pac-Man almost 
immediately. He is referred to as “Blinky”, and the game describes his 
personality as <em>shadow</em>. In Japanese, his personality is referred to as 追いかけ, <em>oikake</em>,
 which translates as “pursuer” or “chaser”. Both languages’ descriptions
 are accurate, since Blinky’s target tile in Chase mode is defined as 
Pac-Man’s current tile. This ensures that Blinky almost always follows 
directly behind Pac-Man, unless the short-sighted decision-making causes
 him to take an inefficient path.</p>

<p>Even though Blinky’s targeting method is very simple, he does have 
one idiosyncrasy that the other ghosts do not; at two defined points in 
each level (based on the number of dots remaining), his speed increases 
by 5% and his behavior in Scatter mode changes. The timing of the speed 
change varies based on the level, with the change occurring earlier and 
earlier as the player progresses. The change to Scatter targeting is 
perhaps more significant than the speed increases, since it causes 
Blinky’s target tile to remain as Pac-Man’s position even while in 
Scatter mode, instead of his regular fixed tile in the upper-right 
corner. This effectively keeps Blinky in Chase mode permanently, though 
he will still be forced to reverse direction as a result of a mode 
switch. When in this enhanced state, Blinky is generally referred to as 
“Cruise Elroy”, though the origin of this term seems to be unknown. Not 
even the almighty Pac-Man Dossier has an answer here. If Pac-Man dies 
while Blinky is in Cruise Elroy mode, he reverts back to normal behavior
 temporarily, but returns to Elroy mode as soon as all other ghosts have
 exited the ghost house.</p>

<h3>The Pink Ghost</h3>

<img class="right" src="understanding-pac-man-ghost-behavior_files/pinky-targeting.png"><img class="right" src="understanding-pac-man-ghost-behavior_files/pinky-targeting2.png"><p>The
 pink ghost starts inside the ghost house, but always exits immediately,
 even in the first level. His nickname is “Pinky”, and his personality 
is described as <em>speedy</em>. This is a considerable departure from his Japanese personality description, which is 待ち伏せ, <em>machibuse</em>,
 which translates as “ambusher”. The Japanese version is much more 
appropriate, since Pinky does not move faster than any of the other 
ghosts (and slower than Blinky in Cruise Elroy mode), but his targeting 
scheme attempts to move him to the place where Pac-Man is going, instead
 of where he currently is. Pinky’s target tile in Chase mode is 
determined by looking at Pac-Man’s current position and orientation, and
 selecting the location four tiles straight ahead of Pac-Man. At least, 
this was the intention, and it works when Pac-Man is facing to the left,
 down, or right, but when Pac-Man is facing upwards, an <a href="http://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FArithmetic_overflow&amp;t=ZjRkMGRjNDA4N2NlOTJkZTYxNzUxOGY3Y2VjNWYyOWFmZGE0M2FiNyxoZFVVbmpJRg%3D%3D" target="_blank">overflow error</a> in the game’s code causes Pinky’s target tile to actually be set as four tiles ahead of Pac-Man <em>and</em>
 four tiles to the left of him. I don’t wish to frighten off 
non-programmers, but if you’re interested in the technical details 
behind this bug, <a href="http://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Fdonhodges.com%2Fpacman_pinky_explanation.htm&amp;t=NzU5NDg4YWVmYjdlN2E3NWFiMzkzNWM1OTcxMjFmOTc4ZGZjZjE0MyxoZFVVbmpJRg%3D%3D" target="_blank">Don Hodges has written a great explanation</a> (<a href="http://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Fwebcache.googleusercontent.com%2Fsearch%3Fhl%3Den%26client%3Dfirefox-a%26hs%3Dc3M%26gl%3Dus%26q%3Dcache%253Awww.donhodges.com%252Fpacman_pinky_explanation.htm%26btnG%3DSearch&amp;t=N2RhODQwMGE4YzU5NzQ5ZTI2Njc3MTc0NWIzMmZmNzRlODU0MTRmOSxoZFVVbmpJRg%3D%3D" target="_blank">Google cache link</a>,
 since the traffic keeps killing his server), including the actual 
assembly code for Pinky’s targeting, as well as a fixed version.</p>

<img class="left" src="understanding-pac-man-ghost-behavior_files/pinky-chicken.png"><p>One
 important implication of Pinky’s targeting method is that Pac-Man can 
often win a game of “chicken” with him. Since his target tile is set 
four tiles in front of Pac-Man, if Pac-Man heads directly towards him, 
Pinky’s target tile will actually be <em>behind</em> himself once they 
are less than four tiles apart. This will cause Pinky to choose to take 
any available turn-off in order to loop back around to his target. 
Because of this, it is a common strategy to momentarily “fake” back 
towards Pinky if he starts following closely. This will often send him 
off in an entirely different direction.</p>

<h3>The Blue Ghost</h3>

<img class="right" src="understanding-pac-man-ghost-behavior_files/inky-targeting.png"><p>The
 blue ghost is nicknamed Inky, and remains inside the ghost house for a 
short time on the first level, not joining the chase until Pac-Man has 
managed to consume at least 30 of the dots. His English personality 
description is <em>bashful</em>, while in Japanese he is referred to as 気紛れ, <em>kimagure</em>,
 or “whimsical”. Inky is difficult to predict, because he is the only 
one of the ghosts that uses a factor other than Pac-Man’s 
position/orientation when determining his target tile. Inky actually 
uses both Pac-Man’s position/facing as well as Blinky’s (the red 
ghost’s) position in his calculation. To locate Inky’s target, we first 
start by selecting the position two tiles in front of Pac-Man in his 
current direction of travel, similar to Pinky’s targeting method. From 
there, imagine drawing a vector from Blinky’s position to this tile, and
 then doubling the length of the vector. The tile that this new, 
extended vector ends on will be Inky’s actual target.</p>

<p>As a result, Inky’s target can vary wildly when Blinky is not near 
Pac-Man, but if Blinky is in close pursuit, Inky generally will be as 
well. Note that Inky’s “two tiles in front of Pac-Man” calculation 
suffers from exactly the same overflow error as Pinky’s four-tile 
equivalent, so if Pac-Man is heading upwards, the endpoint of the 
initial vector from Blinky (before doubling) will actually be two tiles 
up and two tiles left of Pac-Man.</p>

<h3>The Orange Ghost</h3>

<img class="right" src="understanding-pac-man-ghost-behavior_files/clyde-targeting2.png"><img class="right" src="understanding-pac-man-ghost-behavior_files/clyde-targeting.png"><p>The
 orange ghost, “Clyde”, is the last to leave the ghost house, and does 
not exit at all in the first level until over a third of the dots have 
been eaten. Clyde’s English personality description is <em>pokey</em>, whereas the Japanese description is お惚け, <em>otoboke</em>
 or “feigning ignorance”. As is typical, the Japanese version is more 
accurate, since Clyde’s targeting method can give the impression that he
 is just “doing his own thing”, without concerning himself with Pac-Man 
at all. The unique feature of Clyde’s targeting is that it has two 
separate modes which he constantly switches back and forth between, 
based on his proximity to Pac-Man. Whenever Clyde needs to determine his
 target tile, he first calculates his distance from Pac-Man. If he is <em>farther</em>
 than eight tiles away, his targeting is identical to Blinky’s, using 
Pac-Man’s current tile as his target. However, as soon as his distance 
to Pac-Man becomes <em>less</em> than eight tiles, Clyde’s target is set
 to the same tile as his fixed one in Scatter mode, just outside the 
bottom-left corner of the maze.</p>

<img class="center" src="understanding-pac-man-ghost-behavior_files/clyde-targeting3.png"><p>The
 combination of these two methods has the overall effect of Clyde 
alternating between coming directly towards Pac-Man, and then changing 
his mind and heading back to his corner whenever he gets too close. On 
the diagram above, the X marks on the path represent the points where 
Clyde’s mode switches. If Pac-Man somehow managed to remain stationary 
in that position, Clyde would indefinitely loop around that T-shaped 
area. As long as the player is not in the lower-left corner of the maze,
 Clyde can be avoided completely by simply ensuring that you do not 
block his “escape route” back to his corner. While Pac-Man is within 
eight tiles of the lower-left corner, Clyde’s path will end up in 
exactly the same loop as he would eventually maintain in Scatter mode.</p>

<h2>Wrapping Up</h2>

<p>If you’ve made it this far, you should now have a fairly complete 
understanding of the logic behind Pac-Man’s ghost movement. 
Understanding the ghosts’ behavior is probably the single most important
 step towards becoming a skilled Pac-Man player, and even a general idea
 of where they are likely to move next should greatly improve your 
abilities. I’ve never been good at Pac-Man, but while I was researching 
this article and testing a few things, I found that I was able to avoid 
the ghosts much more easily than before. Even small things make a huge 
difference, such as recognizing a switch to Scatter mode and knowing 
that you have a few seconds where the ghosts won’t (deliberately) try to
 kill you.</p>

<p>Pac-Man is an amazing example of seemingly-complex behavior arising 
from only a few cleverly-designed rules, with the result being a deep 
and challenging game that players still strive to master, 30 years after
 its release.</p>
